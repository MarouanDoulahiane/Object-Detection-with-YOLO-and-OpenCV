    "This repo contains notes and implementations based on the [Object Detection with YOLO and OpenCV](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-detection-with-yolo-and-opencv/) tutorial. It covers using `YOLO` for object detection in images and videos, with `OpenCV` for visualization. The guide includes steps for detecting objects in both recorded videos and real-time camera feeds.\n",
